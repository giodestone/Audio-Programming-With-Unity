This was supposed to be part of a musical instrument where you could make it play things with a basic sine synth with a volume and pitch ACAB envelope. Unfortunately I never got it to finish because:
a. multiple playheads and their allocation and deallocation while a sound was getting a bit complicated.
b. weird interference when multiple sounds were playing
c. never actually implemented a pitch envelope (but a volume one is implemented!)
